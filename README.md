# TERRESTRIAL SKY IMAGE CONTRAIL DASHBOARD (TSICD) #

Capstone Project (contrail detection and dashboard) <br>
DAEN 690-DL2 <br>
Team Contrail: Jordan Dutterer, Venkata Sai Ruthvik Pulipaka, Alyssa Soderlund, Jaeho Shin <br>

### Problem Description <br>
Aviation generates 4% of global warming. One half of the aviation contribution is from contrails. Contrails block the outgoing thermal radiation from escaping to space resulting in excess heating of the Earth. Contrails contribute 2% of the total anthropogenic global heating. Researchers have proposed “Navigation Avoidance” of contrails. To operationalize navigational avoidance the location of Ice Super Saturated Regions in the atmosphere, where contrails are generated, needs to be identified. One approach is through using satellite images. This project uses computer vision machine learning to identify contrails in satellite images. Previous research used Landsat images provided by Google. The computer vision machine learning algorithm applied was able to achieve an accuracy of about 50%. This is no better than flipping a coin. This project will use new approaches to computer vision machine learning to detect the presence of contrails in Terrestrial Sky Images and to create a dashboard of contrail statistics. <br><br>
  
  
### Project Goals <br>
The project goals are as follows. <br>
1. Detect the presence of contrails in Terrestrial Sky Images. <br>
2. Create a dashboard of contrail statistics from the Terrestrial Sky Images <br>
